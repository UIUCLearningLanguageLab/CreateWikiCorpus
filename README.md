# Word_V_World

## Background

This is a new project that uses Wikipedia as a corpus from which to extract word co-occurrences. These co-occurrences will later be utilized as experimental stimuli to understand how regularities in language interact with our knowledge about regularities in the world.


## To-do

* better documentation of how corporar were generated
    * move some of the important variables from the wiki-extractor code to params.py
    * add other important variables related to corpus processing to params.py
